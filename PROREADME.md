## Bugs

The project was not complete tom the timescale, further, due an issue loading up on Github, student care was contacted.
The project had a further bug on in its assets folder when assets/css/style.css was changed to assets/style.css.

One bug which took much time and is,finally, resolved was the social-media  font awesome link in the head, which did not
present the social-media icons in the footer. This was resolved by attaining the correct link, with a bit of support from Tutor assistance.

Bug in the font awesome link located in the head. Social media icons were not being presented correctly.
Copied the link from Code Institute font awesome Love Running.
